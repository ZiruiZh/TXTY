# Setting Up Windows XP Bliss Background

If the background is not showing the Windows XP Bliss wallpaper, follow these steps:

1. Download the Windows XP Bliss wallpaper from:
   - https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/0a/Windows_XP_Bliss.png
   - Or search for "Windows XP Bliss wallpaper" and download a high-quality version

2. Save the image file as `bliss.png` in this project folder (same folder as index.html)

3. The code will automatically use the local file if it exists

Alternatively, the code will try to load it from Wikipedia automatically.
