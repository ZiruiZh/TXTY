TXTY's Adventure!

Welcome to TXTY, a simulated gameified computer quiz testing your online privacy and digital footprint.

You will be prompted to act in 7 different scenarios as a student using their laptop, aided by TXTY, a devious computer helper akin to Clippy.

Along the way, the game will keep track of your mistakes, and will assign you a character archetype based on your score.
Finally, depending on where you make mistakes, the game will also generate a to-do list suited to your individual mistakes, with clear and actionable fixes to reduce your digital footprint and increase your online privacy security.

Remember: In real life, always prioritize your online security and privacy. When in doubt, choose the more secure option!
